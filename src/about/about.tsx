                I'm Aaron Honjaya, a BS/MS Computer Science student and Researcher at the University of Washington, Seattle.
                I'll be graduating from my Bachelor's degree this December and starting my masters (also at UW) in January 2026.
                My passion lies with my research in Biomedical Computer Vision, 
                where I focus on developing machine learning models to assist in medical imaging analysis.
                Outside of academics, I enjoy baking, working out, and spending time with friends and family. 
                Thanks for visiting my site!
